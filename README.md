## Spring 2020 - Emily Yaklich 
### Project Goal: Create a classification model that will be able to predict if a protein will be alpha helical transmembrane or not based on sequence features

This project will demonstrate a basic understanding of constructing a machine learning model using Python. The project code and analysis is located in the predicting_TM_identity_Yaklich.ipynb file.
